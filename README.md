This project aims to develop a web application that connects to our customerâ€™s email account, ranks their emails by importance and relevance according to user-defined criteria, and offers the ability to draft editable auto-responses based on user-specified parameters. The primary goal is to streamline email management, improve productivity, and enhance communication for our customer. Additionally, the customers requested data analysis on their most popular videos, looking to recognize more trends of viewer engagement. However, the focus of the project is on the email bot and ranking algorithm.
